My name is Guillermo Grau, and I'm a Spanish telecommunications engineer living in Barcelona.

My professional interests are split 50-50 between systems engineering (I've been working in the aerospace sector for around 15 years) and software engineering. This blog is devoted mainly to the second, although I don't rule out writing about other subjects. After all, it's called *Math.random()*, right?

If you find any of the posts worth a comment, leave it directly here (via Disqus) or contact me through any of the links below. I'll be glad to see this are not some crazy folk's mumblings but something that makes sense!
